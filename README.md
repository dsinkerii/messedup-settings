# ‚ÄºÔ∏è READ BEFORE INSTALLING ‚ÄºÔ∏è

[Here's](https://github.com/dsinkerii/messedup-settings/releases/latest) the latest version of the mod if you dont know how to use github (i refuse to upload on modrinth and curseforge since.... lazzyyy)

üî¥ IF you are the one who is going to edit the settings, make sure to follow these steps:
1. install [dotnet](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) (if u havent already)
2. download & extract the zipfile attached to the release (for example, if you use windows, download `host.1.3.win-x64.zip`)
3. find the executable file to launch it (again, for windows users its `host.exe`, osx and linux = `host`)
4. paste in your password and change your nickname if you want to, and enjoy!

üî¥ IF you are the one running the mod, allowing to change your settings, follow these steps:
1. make sure you have 1.20.1/1.20 fabric installed.
2. After launching the mod, you can now copy the password (in the main menu) needed for your friends that will be editing your settings!

Every time you reboot your game, your padsword changes, so im case it got leaked or something, you can just alt+f4 to reset your password.

If you have any issues with this mod or following any of the steps, feel free to open an issue.
(in case its an emergency (something like a security exploit) feel free to DM me in discord: @dsinkerii (dm's always open))

# how does it work
![what](https://github.com/dsinkerii/messedup-settings/assets/104655906/626da6e5-8ea3-47a4-ba86-8cf079f68bc8)

(very awesome drawing i made in krita at 3am)

In short, we have the host "victim" that will receive all messages from all clients "actors"

We use MQTT, due to the fact that using p2p may be not cool due to the fact your ip will be public for all "actors"

Also, here we use some basic encryption with encrypting all messsages using a simple password

(note, i know NOTHING about cryptology, feel free to open a pull request in case you know how to make it better)
