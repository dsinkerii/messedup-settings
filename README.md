(very awesome drawing i made in krita at 3am)

In short, we have the host "victim" that will receive all messages from all clients "actors"

We use MQTT, due to the fact that using p2p may be not cool due to the fact your ip will be public for all "actors"

Also, here we use some basic encryption with encrypting all messsages using a simple password

(note, i know NOTHING about cryptology, feel free to open a pull request in case you know how to make it better)
